            <h2>The Kintsugi Masterpiece: An Artistic Concept</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Kintsugi</em> is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted with powdered gold. This philosophy, which treats breakage and repair as a beautiful part of an object's history, is our guiding metaphor for salvation history.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Humanity:</strong> A beautiful porcelain vase, crafted by God.</li>
                <li><strong>The Fall (Sin ):</strong> The vase is dropped and shatters.</li>
                <li><strong>The Covenants:</strong> Each covenant is a step in God's meticulous <em>Kintsugi</em> process, filling the cracks with the pure gold of His divine life, making the restored vase more beautiful than the original.</li>
            </ul>

                <!-- CSS will create the artwork here -->
                <div class="artwork-title">The Luminous Blueprint</div>

                <h3>The Original Blueprint</h3>
                <h4>The Adamic Covenant</h4>
                <p><strong>New Perspective:</strong> The Architect's Perfect Design. Before the vase was made, there was a blueprint. This chapter is about the original, intended design for humanity and our relationship with the Architect, God.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Adam wasn't just the first man; he was the blueprint for what it means to be fully human. Created as a "son of God," he was given a five-fold identity (son, priest, king, prophet, bridegroom) that defined his purpose: to live in loving communion with the Architect and care for His creation. This was the state of original perfection, the vase in its flawless, whole state.</p>

                <h3>The Shattering & The First Repair</h3>
                <h4>The Noahic Covenant</h4>
                <p><strong>New Perspective:</strong> Salvage Operation. The masterpiece shatters. The world is flooded with chaos. God's first act isn't to discard the pieces, but to perform a salvage operation—rescuing a remnant to begin the slow process of restoration.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Fall represents the shattering of the vase. God uses the flood not to destroy, but to wash the pieces clean. Noah and his family are the salvaged fragments. The covenant with Noah is God's promise not to abandon the project, sealed with a rainbow—the first glimmer of the golden lacquer to come.</p>

                <h3>Gathering the Key Fragments</h3>
                <h4>The Abrahamic Covenant</h4>
                <p><strong>New Perspective:</strong> The Foundation for the Gold. Before applying the golden lacquer, you must carefully select the key pieces. This is a precision task, focusing on one crucial fragment that will anchor all others.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> God selects Abraham as the foundational piece for His restoration. The binding of Isaac on Mount Moriah proves this "fragment" is strong enough to bear the weight of the entire restoration. God's oath is the moment He commits to using this lineage to channel His golden, divine blessing to the world.</p>

        <!-- Chapter 4 -->
        <section class="chapter-card">
            <div class="chapter-image-container" id="chapter4-art">
                 <div class="artwork-title">The Covenant Performance Chart</div>

                <h3>Structuring the Repair</h3>
                <h4>The Mosaic Covenant</h4>
                <p><strong>New Perspective:</strong> The Scaffolding and the Workshop Rules. The restoration is underway. God provides a structure to hold the pieces together and posts workshop rules to keep the artisans focused.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> On Mount Sinai, God erects the "scaffolding" of the covenant to shape Israel into a priestly people. The Ten Commandments are the "workshop rules." But the workers immediately make a mess (the Golden Calf), showing they can't follow the rules, and requiring more laws to be added because of their weakness.</p>

                <h3>The Foreman of the Project</h3>
                <h4>The Davidic Covenant</h4>
                <p><strong>New Perspective:</strong> Appointing a Master Artisan. The workers have proven unreliable. The Divine Architect now appoints one man—a foreman—to oversee the project. The restoration is now entrusted to this foreman and his lineage.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> God anoints David as king. The divine sonship and priesthood the nation rejected is now invested in him. God's covenant with David promises that his son will build the permanent workshop (the Temple) and that his royal line will be the channel for God's work forever.</p>

            <div class="chapter-text-container">
                <span class="chapter-number">Chapter Six</span>
                <h3>The Project Stalls, The Vision Endures</h3>
                <h4>The New Covenant</h4>
                <p><strong>New Perspective:</strong> A Worksite Abandoned, but the Blueprint is Rediscovered. The foreman's successors fail. The workshop is destroyed. But then, prophets arise who have rediscovered the original blueprint and promise the Master Architect will return to finish the job Himself.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The kingdom collapses and the people are exiled. All seems lost. But prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel speak of a "New Covenant" where God Himself will intervene. They are promising that the Kintsugi Master is coming to apply the golden lacquer personally.</p>

                <h3>The Master Arrives</h3>
                <h4>The Eucharistic Covenant</h4>
                <p><strong>New Perspective:</strong> Kintsugi in Flesh and Blood. The Master Artisan arrives. He doesn't just bring the gold; He *is* the gold. He allows Himself to be broken to perfectly fill the cracks of the shattered masterpiece, making it whole and holy.</p>
                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Jesus is the fulfillment of all promises. The Cross is the workbench. His own Body and Blood are the divine, golden lacquer. He is broken (the Crucifixion) and poured out (the Eucharist) to mend our brokenness. The river of blood and water from His side is the flow of the Holy Spirit, the golden lacquer that makes us children of God.</p>
